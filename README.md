Preliminary mission design to Uranus with patched-conics method

The scope of this project is to design a trajectory from Earth to Uranus using several FlyBys and compare it with the classic Hohmann Transfer in terms of total DeltaV and mission time.

Run Direct_Hohamnn_Transfer_script.m , Departure_Date_Patched_conics.m and Patched_conics_script.m to reproduce all results and graphics.

Code is organized as follows :

Code/: various functions and scripts ;

Algorithms_from_Curtis/: functions taken(and some of which modified) from Orbital Mechanics For Engineering Students , Howard D. Curtis ;

Graphics/: functions for graphics and animations generation ;

porkchop/: code for generation of porkchops plots, from https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39248-interplanetary-pork-chop-plots.html ;
